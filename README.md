🧠 Architecture Decisions
Modular Folder Structure
Designed using NestJS modules for separation of concerns and clean scaling. Example modules: auth, users, events, bookings.

MongoDB with Mongoose
Chosen for its flexibility with structured and unstructured data such as event details, user bookings, and participation records. Efficient indexing and lean queries optimize performance.

JWT for Authentication
JWT tokens support access and refresh tokens with customizable expiry times. Role-based access control ensures secure route gating for Admins, Organizers, and Users.

Email Notifications via Nodemailer
Integrated to send transactional emails such as booking confirmations and event updates.

Real-time Updates (Planned)
Architecture anticipates future WebSocket or Server-Sent Events integration for live event status and booking notifications.

🔐 Authentication Flow
Users register and receive JWT tokens upon login.

Tokens authorize protected routes such as creating or booking events.

Role-based access controls restrict management endpoints to Admins and Organizers.

Refresh tokens and session management to be implemented for enhanced security.


📌 TODO (Next Steps)
 Implement real-time event notifications

 Add rate limiting and spam protection

 Extend test coverage and documentation

 Add pagination for event and booking lists

 Integrate user profile management (e.g., profile images)

✨ Why This Project?
This API is designed to power scalable, secure event management platforms — ideal for:

Community-driven events and meetups

Online and offline booking systems

Event organizers seeking reliable backend infrastructure

Platforms requiring real-time booking and update capabilities
